### Norm writing

This project is written in accordance to the norm of school 42. Some of the most important norm rules are:
- Each function has a maximum of 25 lines
- One single variable declaration per line, all variables on top of the function 
- After the variable declarations, a newline will split them with the rest of the function
- No for loops allowed


## Install and run the project

First, clone my repository on your computer via the green "code" button on top of this page.
All the functions can be compiled using my Makefile. This Makefile has several options:
- run <code>make</code> to create object files for all the standard functions, and a archive library pipex.a


- run <code>make clean</code> to delete all the object files
- run <code>make fclean</code> to delete all the object files and the libft.a file.
- run <code>make re</code> recompile the library.
